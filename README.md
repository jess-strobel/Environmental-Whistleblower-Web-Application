# Environmental Whistleblower Web Application

This project was created as part of the University of Virginia's Software Engineering course. The site allows users to report an environmental violation, either anonymously or using their Google account. Users who sign in to the site can view the status of their submitted reports as well as any actions taken as a result of these submissions. Users granted administrator access can view all submitted reports, make submission status changes, and leave comments for users regarding the outcome of their reports. 

Access the site here: https://whistleblower-b-21-3d4d90ef9657.herokuapp.com/

_Note that this application was created for a class project and is not actively monitored._
